implement sha256
socket programming for communication 
file disassembly and reassembly

client authentication - using username password? 
session key set using DH key exchange? 

file encryption decryption

MULTITHREADING REQUIRED
CLIENT should be able to upload files to the server

Folder structure
- server
- client

rsa public key - configuration

confidentiality = how to use a keyed hash algorithm for securing communication
we can use a library to authenticate the server.

2 programs
1 server
- dedicated port
- server accepts files and stores - /clientname/file1
    
    2 operations - upload a file / download a file 
    upload a file 
    name of file 

client is run in two modes - ./CLIENT download filename 

server has a public key. decrypt first request with its own private key. 

server.config
application.config
- server public key
- port range

1 client - support for all types of files needs to be tested

rsa public keys  with usernames

support for multiple clients at the same time. 
what one client uploads , can only those files be downloaded or all files can?

What do we use for encryption?
